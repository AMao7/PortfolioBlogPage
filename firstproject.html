									<h2>Hello World</h2>
						
									<p>I've never really written a blog anymore and I really don't know how, but what I will share with you, the world
                                    or whoever is interested, my Journey into DevOps. This begins with my first ever project in DevOps - and that is building
                                    a fully functional pipeline for a JS app by hitting one command <code>terraform apply</code>. The job was to create a load balanced autoscaling 2 tier architecture (for the app and database).
                                    The Architecture also needed to be a "Highly Available" application, meaning that it has redundancies across all three availability zones. A lot right, especially on my first big project, but more
                                    than anything I was excited and felt confident.
                                  </p>
                               
                                     <hr>
									<h2> Day 1 </h2>
									<h5>it was a lot</h5>

                                    <p>
                                        For this particular project I utilised Chef as the main configuration management tool to provision the environment, (I know, not ansible huh), but I wil use ansible for the next project so don't worry! The first part
                                        of the CI/CD pipeline was to run integration and unit tests from Chef in Jenkins automatically after any changes to the code (through webhooks) using <code>chef exec rspec spec</code> and <code>kitchen test</code>
                                        . The next stage of our CI/CD pipeline was to create an AMI image using packer. I've never used packer before this and almost had no clue how I would do this. However, I then realised Packer
                                        is written in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), which I've conveniently used before whilst learning python. Packer, in short is an open source tool that is used 
										 to create images (snapshots or templates used for the creation of virtual servers) that can be used for multiple platforms, including Amazon Web Services (AWS) which I used for this particular project. 
										 Although I faced many challenges including setting my environmental variables correctly, I managed to script the json file to call AWS to create an AMI image using the chef script that'll provision my environment.

                                    <h2>AWS Shenanigians</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        The cloudformation tool used for this project was <b> Amazon Web Services (AWS)</b>, and before I completed my AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification (a story I hope to share in the future). I almost had no clue
										the whats and hows on this service and its capabilities. Whilst working on AWS, I truly understood the capabilities of hosting environments on the cloud. The ability to scale (from 1 to 1000 instances) is second to none. But anyways, I had to learn how to create an instance with a Virtual Private Cloud on AWS first,
										 before even trying to automate it using Packer. 
                                    </p>


                                    <h2>Replica Sets sets sets</h2>
                                    <p> A key requirement for this project was to replicate the database used for the app in the event of downtime. A ReplicaSet's purpose is to maintain a stable number (3 in this case)
										of  databases running at any given time to ensure zero downtime. Doing this was quite difficult and took a lot of understanding of networks to fulfill. To create a ReplicaSet, you first
									have to establish the primary database, of which the primary node will receives all write operations. This will constantly monitor the secondary databases by pinging their ip addresses and checking it's 'heartbeat'. 
									In the case of a downtime, the secondary databases take an election and one of them becomes the new primary! Pretty cool right, well I thought so anyways. <code>rs.initate</code> begins the ReplicaSet, you can then <code>rs.add('secondary-ip-addresses')</code> to then 
									add your secondary databases (2 of them were used in this project). </p>

                                    <h2>Time was slipping away</h2>
                                       <p>A week left to get this done and we just couldn't the NodeJs app and mongodb database to "seed" through terraform scripting. After actual days of collaboration we finally managed to figure it and yep it
                                        because they were on different ports :D. Despite this loss of time and our frustration, I was positive that we would get this project done in time, after all - who doesn't love a challenge.

                                    <h2>Monitoring using the ELK stack</h2>
                                    <p>
                                        Immutable architectures are notoriously difficult to debug because we no longer have access to the instances and thus do not have access to the logs for those machines.
                                        Log consolidation allows us to have logs files broadcast to a central repository by the instances themselves which allows us to more easily view them.
                                        The ELK stack is a commonly used system for this purpose. Elk is made up of Elastic Search, Logstash and Kibana and also Beats.
                                    </p>
                                    <figure>

                                        <em> , Elasticsearch is a search engine that supports real-time search</em></a1>
                                        <em> and Logstash allows you to store and collect logs for future use.</em>

										<h2>Terraform</h2>
										<p> Terraform is the main orchestration tool I used in this project and will manage the whole infrastructure. All the different services in AWS (VPC, EC2 instances for app/db/elk)
											that I needed for this project was done through terraform. You can use terraform to handle your infrastructure as code and to be honest it is fairly simple to use, so I 
											definitely do recommend working with it, if you're dealing with infrastructure. Terraform can run scripts inside the environment (through shell commands) if you wanted it do, and that's exactly what I did
											to get the replica sets I talked about earlier to communicate with each other. <p>

											</p>
									
											
											
											After two weeks of solid work, the project was finally complete. By running <code>terraform apply</code> our whole infrastructure is created, terraform will use the images made
											from Packer and will boot up instances for our app, our database (and it's ReplicaSets) and our monitoring tool ELK stack.

												in AWS for the infrastructure</a></small></p></em>

										<h2>Challenges</h2>
										<p>I faced a lot of challenges during this project including getting the ReplicaSets to communicate with each other (and testing this by terminating the instances to see if one takes over). I also had issues
										   getting the app and databases the seed over the cloud. These were all valid reasons for me to get demotivated and frustrated, but to be honest I quite enjoyed dealing with the setbacks, I took
										   my time to understand each problem and managed to both solve them and learn something new at the same time!
										</p>

										<h2>What I learnt</h2>
										<p>I learnt the power of perseveration and getting things done quickly with a deadline.
