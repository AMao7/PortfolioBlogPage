									<h2>An update</h2>
						
									<p>As you guys know, the world's become very different with the coronavirus pandemic and I hope you are all staying safe. Since the pandemic, I've been fortunate enough to start a new job as a DevOps engineer and its been going 
										great so far. Please accept my apologies for the huge time gap since my last post, I am planning on doing more projects to add to this blog. With that being said 
										lets talk AWS!
                                  </p>

									 <h2>How I got AWS Certified</h2>
									 <p>I had a lot of time free, so I decided I wanted to get the AWS Cloud Practitioner certificate. To boost my productivity and also give me some needed anxiety to actually prepare for the exam, I booked the test before I even started revising. I spent quite a lot of time watching some Udemy videos as well as doing practice papers until I was 
										 getting 90%+ in each attempt. I took my proctored exam and passed! I plan on getting my AWS Solutions Architect certificate at some point, probably in a few months time.

									<h2> Why even bother getting certifications? </h2>
									<h5></h5>

                                    <p>
										There are some pretty good reasons, the first being It'll make your CV a bit more competitive- knowing things is all good but being able to prove it is another. Getting a certification verifies that you have attained a level of knowledge equal to its content.
										When I was considering getting a certificate, I'd read how someone compared it to getting "your AWS driving license" - which actually sums it up pretty nicely. Other reasons to getting the certificates is to test your knowledge aswell as build up on it, its a really good
										way to up skill yourself.

									<h2>What AWS certificates are out there</h2>
									<h4>And which one is for you</h4>
                                    <p>
										There's 4 levels of certification, Foundational - Associate - Professional and Specialty. You should start off with the foundational level - The AWS Cloud Practitioner certificate (this is the one I did), this exam will test your
										knowledge on AWS's key services as well as good practices to have when dealing with cloud infrastructure. The following level is associate and comprises of 3 different certificates, Solutions architect (for individuals who want/is working in a solutions architect role),
										Developer (for developers who maintain aws-based applications) and lastly SysOps administrator (for sysadmins who utilise aws). The two levels after this are Professional and Specialty, these are the highest level of certification and optimally you'd want to get the 
									previously mentioned certifications first before you do them.                                    </p>

										<h2>Challenges</h2>
										<p>Compared to my last project I didn't face many challenges, but I was very nervous to doing my first certificate exam. Overall, I was very happy to have passed and im looking forward to doing more
											in the future!
